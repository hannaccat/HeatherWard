Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

âœ¨Welcome to my profileâœ¨

I'm a recent college grad ðŸŽ“ working my first Dev job as a .NET/C# developer specializing in Web APIs. Eventually, I want to merge my passion for programming with my passion to be creative and grow into a Frontend Engineering role ðŸ”¥. My goal over the next few months it improve my skills in Javascript, React, Bootstrap, MaterialUI, and UX/UI design practices. While also building up my portfolio and showcasing them on my personal website.
